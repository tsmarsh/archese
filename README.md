#Archese

I've been enamored by Clojure for some time, but there are a couple of
things that are going to be hard to solve as long as it is hosted on
the JVM.

This project is an experiment, first in building a lisp, something
I've never done, but also in discovering if ownership and borrowing
work as well in Clojure as I suspect they will.
